# boot-test

[![Clojars Project][1]][2]

[Boot] task for running clojure.test tests

## Usage

Add `boot-test` to your `build.boot` dependencies and `require` the
namespace:

```clj
(set-env! :dependencies '[[adzerk/boot-test "X.Y.Z" :scope "test"]])
(require '[adzerk.boot-test :refer [tests]])
```

If your tests are in a directory that is not included in the classpath, you will need to add it

```
(set-env! :src-paths #{"test"})
```

You can see the options available on the command line:

```bash
$ boot tests -h
```

or in the REPL:

```clj
boot.user=> (doc tests)
```

## Continuous Testing

Whisper some magic incantations to boot, and it will run tests every time you save a file
```
boot watch tests
```
with sound!
```
boot watch speak tests
```
